Hello Dear Professor,

This is my last assignment for this cours ( Responsive Web Design II).

For this assignment we were supposed to make a portfolio website based on what we learned in this course.

During this course we tried grid and flex elements on our assignments so I decided to make my portfolio by bootstrap framework.

I just used bootstrap, HTML5 and CSS3 for this portfolio.

I devided the website into 5 sections and used lorem ipsum text.

I used images from pexels.com

I wanted to use some java scripts but due to this self-isolations I found it a little bit hard to use it for the first time by myself.

I hope you like it.

Thank you for the great semester and hope to have you our professor again.
